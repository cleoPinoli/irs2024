<h1>Internet, Reti e Sicurezza 2024</h1>
I created and gave these notes for free to the students of the bachelor course of <i>Internet, Reti e Sicurezza</i> (lit. <i>"Internet, Networks and (network) Security"</i>), part of the degree programme of Informatics at the University of Camerino UNICAM.

The source of these notes is a mix between:
- Kurose-Ross, "Reti di Calcolatori e Internet" ("Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach"), 2nd and 8th Ed.;
- Lectures and lecture slides;
- Various websites and articles, often cited as footnotes.

Note: because the course is held in Italian (and so is the final exam), these notes are in Italian as well.
