<h1>Internet, Reti e Sicurezza 2024</h1>
I created and gave these notes for free to the students of the bachelor course of <i>Internet, Reti e Sicurezza</i> (lit. <i>"Internet, Networks and (network) Security"</i>), part of the degree programme of Informatics at the University of Camerino UNICAM.

The source of these notes is a mix between:
- Kurose-Ross, "Reti di Calcolatori e Internet" ("Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach"), 2nd and 8th Ed.;
- Lectures and lecture slides;
- Various websites and articles, often cited as footnotes.

<h1>How to Use</h1>
Importing and compiling this archive should be fairly simple: clone/download this repository on your device, import the project (as a compressed .ZIP folder) on your preferred LaTeX environment (I usually go for Overleaf) and compile the source code. Package dependencies are resolved very easily in Overleaf, I'm not sure if it has to be done manually on other platforms TBH.

Note: because the course is held in Italian (and so is the final exam), these notes are in Italian as well.

Also Note: I first redacted these notes in 2021 with good ol' pen and paper, and later digitalised, expanded and corrected them where I would notice mistakes and inaccuracies: this, however, does not guarantee absolute correctness of every notion in there - mistakes could happen!

If you spot any, I'd be glad if you let me know! Contact me via e-mail at raffaelli.cleo@gmail.com
